# Forecasting HIV Trends in Singapore (1985-2023) using ARIMA Modelling

This project analyzes the temporal trends of HIV cases in Singapore from 1985 to 2023 using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. HIV remains a critical public health challenge, with its epidemiology evolving over the decades. By applying ARIMA, this project aims to uncover patterns in historical data, provide accurate forecasts for future trends, and support evidence-based policy-making and resource planning to combat HIV effectively.

Future Work (Ongoing):
- Develop hybrid models combining ARIMA with ML techniques for better long-term projections. 
- Compare ARIMA with alternative models using metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and AIC.
